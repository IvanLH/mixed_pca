# Mixed PCA

The literature for *PCA* (acronym for Principal Component Analsys) consists mostly on dealing with quantitative variables which are preferably continuous. Koch gives a mathematical insight on why this is desirable on her book [**Analysis of Multivariate and High-Dimensional Data**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/analysis-of-multivariate-and-highdimensional-data/2BF8DE949E18E3A68001976784087816).

The goal of this project is to create a robust PCA algorithm that can handle quantitative variables such as ordinal and continuous and qualitative variables.
